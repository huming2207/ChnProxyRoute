# ChnProxyRule List

**"Together WE MAKE CHINESE ONLINE SERVICES GREAT AGAIN!"**

This is a project inspired and forked from [Unblock-Youku](https://github.com/uku/Unblock-Youku/blob/master/shared/urls.js). Since some enterprise networks do not allow using 3rd-party DNS servers or HTTP proxies (e.g. our University) while they do allow some encrypted SOCKS proxy connections. So I can use this list with Shadowsocks (proxying back to China) as an alternative choice for the original Unblock-Youku project.

Basically I just copy all their rules and change it to Adblock Plus Filter list format. It should works with some proxies software like [Shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks) or SwitchyOmega in Chrome.
